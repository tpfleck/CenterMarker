# Changelog

## 0.6.0
- Added instance-based visibility options (In/Not in Instance) with hover info for instance types.
- Updated “Show when” labels for clarity and widened the config frame so the tooltip fits.
- Kept combat visibility options and other settings intact; existing encounter settings migrate to instance automatically.
